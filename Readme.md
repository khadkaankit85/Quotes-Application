This is a very simple application. Which has variety of jokes and advices. It fetches data from mariaDB and other APIS. The front-end library used is react and back-end is made with Node.js.

//to run this application:
//we need to first run react program which uses port 5173:
----------npm run dev on Application folder
// we need to turn on the server which uses port 3000
--------node server.js or nodemon server.js if you are using Nodemon
//we need to turn on xampp (mariaDB) which uses port 3306 and is the database of the program.
---use xampp to create your own database and connect it to node application which is not that difficult honestly.
